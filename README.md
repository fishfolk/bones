Bones is a work-in-progress game engine that gives you everything you need to make real games. The bones framework can be rendered with [Bevy], but is fundamentally engine agnostic and comes with it's own ECS, asset server, and user experience. Bones is officially focused on 2D games, but can be used for 3D games too if you are willing to create custom rendering integrations.

Bones is used in the [Jumpy] game, and will possibly be used in other FishFolk games in the future.

## Overview

### Bones ECS

Bones is designed around a simple, custom Entity Component System ( ECS ), designed to make it easier to get a few features that are important to us:

- **Determinism:** Bones ECS is deterministic by default, making it easier to get a re-producible and predictable gameplay.
- **Snapshot/Restore:** The Bones ECS world can be trivially snapshot and restored.
- **Modding/Scripting ( work-in-progress ):** Bones ECS is built on our [`bones_schema`] system, which allows for runtime reflection and the ability to interact with data types defined outside of Rust.

[`bones_schema`]: https://fishfolk.github.io/bones/rustdoc/bones_schema/index.html

Determinism and Snapshot/Restore are also key features for getting excellent **network play** with the rollback networking model, while requiring no changes to the core game loop implementation.

### Bones Lib

The [`bones_lib`] contains the [`bones_ecs`] and the [`bones_asset`] system. It defines the concept of a [`Game`] which contains all of your game logic and data in a collection of [`Session`]s that each have their own ECS [`World`].

Bones lib has no rendering components or even math types, it is only concerned with organizing your game logic and assets.

[`World`]: https://fishfolk.github.io/bones/rustdoc/bones_lib/ecs/struct.World.html

### Bones Framework

On top of [`bones_lib`] there is the [`bones_framework`], which defines the rendering components and math types. Right now [`bones_framework`] is focused only on 2D rendering. 3D is not a priority for us now, but there is no technical limitation preventing community developed 3D rendering components either on top of [`bones_lib`] directly or as an extension to the [`bones_framework`].

### Bones Bevy Renderer

A game created with the [`bones_framework`] is renderer agnostic. This allows us to create rendering integrations with other engines. Our official integration is with the [Bevy] engine. The [`bones_bevy_renderer`] allows you to create a Bevy `App` for rendering a [`bones_framework`] game.

This also allows you to create custom extensions to the Bevy renderer, if you need a bones integration with a feature not supported out-of-the-box in the [`bones_framework`].
